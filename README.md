# Stephan El Khoury - Dynamic Portfolio Platform

A fully dynamic, block-based portfolio platform built with Next.js App Router, Prisma, and PostgreSQL. Content is managed from an admin dashboard (no code edits needed for normal updates).

## 🚀 Features

- **Block-based content system**: Hero/About/Experience/Contact managed in DB
- **Dynamic projects**: DB-backed list (currently intentionally empty)
- **Supported systems showcase**: Clickable logos to detailed stack/platform pages
- **Admin dashboard**: JSON-powered CMS at `/admin`
- **Live chatbot**: Gemini-powered assistant trained from your live DB content
- **Chat persistence**: Every chat session/message saved and visible in admin
- **Vercel ready**: Uses environment variables and server APIs

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js Route Handlers
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM
- **AI**: Gemini (`gemini-2.0-flash`) via `@google/genai`
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stephan-portfolio.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd stephan-portfolio
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create both `.env` and `.env.local` in the root directory (or copy `.env.example`) and add:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
   DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED="postgresql://..."
   ADMIN_DASHBOARD_TOKEN="your-secure-token"
   GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-key"
   ```

4. Generate Prisma client, push schema, and seed full dataset:
   ```bash
   npm run prisma:generate
   npm run prisma:push
   npm run prisma:seed
   ```

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Open [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333) in your browser.
7. Open `/admin`, paste `ADMIN_DASHBOARD_TOKEN`, then load/save content.

## Database Operations

### Professional Experience Pages

Each published item in the `experience-main` block gets a detail page at
`/experience/<company-and-role>`, linked from the timeline and included in the sitemap.
The role, company, period, description, and focus areas use the same CMS content as the homepage.

Experience items also support these optional JSON fields:

- `slug`: a unique lowercase, hyphenated URL identifier. Set this to keep a URL stable when renaming a role or company.
- `achievements`: an array of responsibility or accomplishment descriptions shown under "My work".
- `tools`: an array of tool and technology names.
- `deliverables`: an array of specific outputs or completed work.

CMS detail fields override the existing role-specific content in `src/lib/experience-details.ts`.
New roles without detail fields still show their description and focus areas. Omit optional fields
to use existing details; use an empty array to hide a detail list. Use only verified, publicly shareable work.

- Seed data only:
   ```bash
   npm run prisma:seed
   ```
- Full destructive reset + reseed:
   ```bash
   npm run prisma:reset
   ```
